permute_url(urls)
}

\item{urls}{A character vector of URLs.}
}

A data.frame with two columns: `OriginalURL` (the input URL) and
  `Permutation` (the generated URL variant).
}
\description{
Generates various permutations of a URL, altering scheme, www prefix, and trailing slash.
}
\details{
As an SEO expert I need to create altenative variants of URLs for joining data.frames,
comparing reports, etc. Various tools may report URLs in various formats:
with or without the protocol, with or without www, and with http or https
as the protocol and with or without the trailing slash.

permute_url("example.com/path?query=1")
permute_url(c("http://www.test.co.uk/one", "another.com/two/"))
