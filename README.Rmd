# rurl

`rurl` is a small, pipe-friendly, and vectorized R package that helps you
construct and parse URLs from components. It is designed to make HTTP endpoint
generation readable, composable, and easy to integrate into modern R workflows.

It includes helpers to:
- Get cleaned URLs
- Extract domains, paths, schemes, and hosts
- Normalize or strip protocols

## Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("bart-turczynski/rurl")
```

## Example

```r
library(rurl)

get_clean_url("example.com/path")
#> "http://example.com/path"

get_domain("https://sub.example.co.uk/page")
#> "example.co.uk"

get_scheme("example.com", protocol_handling = "none")
#> NA
```

## Data Sources

This package includes a processed copy of the [Public Suffix List (PSL)](https://publicsuffix.org/), used to extract top-level domains.  
It is updated manually via `data-raw/update_psl.R`. The original list is maintained by Mozilla and hosted at:
https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat
The data is included in accordance with the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/blob/main/LICENSE) and is never downloaded at runtime. See `inst/LICENSE.psl` for full license text.

To refresh it:

```r
# From the root of the package:
source("data-raw/update_psl.R")
```

This regenerates the internal `sysdata.rda` file used for domain parsing.
